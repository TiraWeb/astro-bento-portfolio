Hi there! This is Tiran, and I’m a 17-year-old DevOps trainee. Growing up, I was a huge fan of Minecraft. I remember countless hours spent building worlds and creating memories with friends in the game. But I never imagined that my love for Minecraft would lead me to where I am today: pursuing a career in cloud computing!

Back when I was 15, setting up Minecraft servers was my favorite hobby. I’d tinker with configurations, install mods, and do whatever it took to create the perfect gaming experience for my friends and me. Little did I know, I was developing some essential skills that would later become the foundation of my cloud computing journey.

Fast forward to today, I’m now working with cloud technologies that share many similarities with those Minecraft servers from my younger days. Concepts like resource management, networking, and security are all essential aspects I picked up from running my own game servers. It’s amazing how a childhood passion can shape your future in unexpected ways!
