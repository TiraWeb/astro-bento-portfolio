Hi there, Tiran here! As a 17-year-old tech enthusiast in Sri Lanka, I found myself captivated by the limitless potential of machine learning. The idea of teaching computers to learn from data and make intelligent decisions seemed like the stuff of science fiction. I was hooked, spending hours watching courses about the latest advancements and dreaming of one day working in this field at a big tech company like Discord/Nvidia.

However, as much as I wanted to dive deeper into machine learning, I soon discovered that opportunities in Sri Lanka were scarce. There were limited resources, and finding interns or like-minded individuals to collaborate with proved challenging. While my love for machine learning never waned, I began to realize that pursuing it professionally would be an uphill battle.
