Hey there, it's Tiran again! In my previous blog posts, I've shared how my early experiences with Minecraft and machine learning shaped my IT journey. Today, I want to talk about the valuable lessons I've learned from participating in hackathons and working on school projects that involved web development and AWS services.

Hackathons have been instrumental in expanding my knowledge of web development, AWS, and cloud technologies. Collaborating with fellow students on time-sensitive projects taught me the importance of effective communication, time management, and teamwork. Through these events, I learned to appreciate the challenges of working in IT, especially when team members might not always be equally committed.

I've also had the opportunity to explore various AWS services and sharpen my cloud computing skills through these projects. This hands-on experience has been invaluable in helping me transition from a student to a DevOps trainee.
