My personal Website <br> <br>

Hey there! Been exploring DevOps lately and it's been a challenging but interesting journey. I'm all about Docker, Kubernetes, AWS, and Terraform - they're my go-to tools/platforms for getting things done. From containerization to cloud management, I've been digging into it all. Super stoked to keep growing my DevOps skills and see where this journey takes me in the tech world! <br> <br>
